Parapsychology
The Koestler Parapsychology Unit takes a broad approach to parapsychology, conducting research into the psi hypothesis, 
pseudo-psi (‘what’s not psychic but looks like it’), beliefs about the paranormal and the history of accounts and studies 
of anomalous phenomena. For further information on our research, visit the KPU website.
